            information needed is the short circuit impedance and the current injection
            kV_nom: external grid nominal voltage in the connection point

            one of the following is needed:
                Z_SC_ohms: impedance in ohms
                S_SC_MVA: short circuit capacity in MVA
                I_SC_kamps: short circuit current in kAmperes

            assumption:
                - external grid is unloaded (its not included in the power flow)
                - uses the R/X ratio from IEC 60909
                - external grid voltage is at nominal and = base voltage
                - external grid internal voltage is constant
            reality:
                - can be measured and the current source can be quantified as a 
                    constant current source (similar as a SG)
                - this objects work for both cases
